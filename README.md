# GAMMO Portal

Neon link portal to all things GAMMO – with particles, secret intro, and a Konami-code hidden chamber.

## ✨ Features

- **Neon landing card** with floating orb logo and animated orbits  
- **Hacking console intro** that types system messages on load  
- **Cosmic portal animation** before revealing the main page  
- **Cursor-following neon particles** for that “the page is alive” feel  
- **Konami code Easter egg** (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) that unlocks:
  - A secret “GAMMO // HIDDEN CHAMBER” slide-out panel  
  - A meme roast for people who spent too long on the site  
  - Extra hidden links & a small synth sound
